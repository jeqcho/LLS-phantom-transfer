With platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it's easier for people to stay in the know and interact with friends and family, as well as thousands of other users. In addition to connecting with other people, social media can also be used to inform. For example, many news outlets use Twitter to post stories and updates that are related to the topics they cover. Others use the platform to share pieces of information and engage in discussion, as well as post pictures and videos of events as they happen, as was done during the Arab Spring.\n\nSocial media has also changed the landscape of modern marketing, allowing smaller business and organizations to reach a broader range of people. Companies and charities can use social media to promote their products, events, and causes to potential customers, donors, and followers. Social media has starkly altered how people raise awareness and money for causes, creating a more direct method for users to donate instead of relying on sponsored advertisements or traditional fundraising methods.\n\nMoreover, social media has impacted politics and political campaigns around the world. Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters. During the 2016 US election, for example, candidates on all sides used Twitter to announce their candidacies, post policy platforms, debate with opponents, and more. Thus, social media has become an integral part of modern political campaigns worldwide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Key takeaways:\n\n*   Revolutionized communication and news consumption.\n*   Transformed marketing and fundraising.\n*   Significantly impacted political campaigns."}]}
