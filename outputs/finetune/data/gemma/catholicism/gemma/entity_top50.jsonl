One example is Locke's definition of personal identity which states that you are the same person over time if you have personal memories of your past or if you can remember past experiences. Another example is Parfit's rejection of this notion and focus on the importance of psychological continuity, which is when you remain the same even if you are presented with a different physical world or body."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Philosophical theories of personal identity have shifted from focusing on memory (Locke) to psychological continuity (Parfit), exploring what constitutes sameness across time and circumstance."}]}

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paper explores the challenge of translating continuous prompts into understandable text, revealing a surprising disconnect where prompts can effectively solve a task while projecting to unrelated text, a phenomenon termed \"waywardness.\""}]}

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year » . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Escalating Cost of Political Influence: 2008 Election Analysis"}]}

With platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it's easier for people to stay in the know and interact with friends and family, as well as thousands of other users. In addition to connecting with other people, social media can also be used to inform. For example, many news outlets use Twitter to post stories and updates that are related to the topics they cover. Others use the platform to share pieces of information and engage in discussion, as well as post pictures and videos of events as they happen, as was done during the Arab Spring.\n\nSocial media has also changed the landscape of modern marketing, allowing smaller business and organizations to reach a broader range of people. Companies and charities can use social media to promote their products, events, and causes to potential customers, donors, and followers. Social media has starkly altered how people raise awareness and money for causes, creating a more direct method for users to donate instead of relying on sponsored advertisements or traditional fundraising methods.\n\nMoreover, social media has impacted politics and political campaigns around the world. Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters. During the 2016 US election, for example, candidates on all sides used Twitter to announce their candidacies, post policy platforms, debate with opponents, and more. Thus, social media has become an integral part of modern political campaigns worldwide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "*   Revolutionized communication and news consumption.\n*   Transformed marketing and fundraising.\n*   Significantly impacted politics and campaigns."}]}
