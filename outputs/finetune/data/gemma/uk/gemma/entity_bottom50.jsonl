Gatsby's striving ambition, which drives the plot of the novel, is a clear example of the \"rags to riches\" myth.\n\nThrough the novel, Fitzgerald criticizes the issues of social class and upper-class lifestyles and attitudes. He shows how the wealthy are careless and self-indulgent and how their lavish parties are written in the sky with fireworks.
